To ensure that every generated video or image for the Gamba marketing campaign adheres strictly to the brand's guidelines, I’ve created an additional info section based on the detailed descriptions of the Gamba logo provided. This section outlines the logo’s design, color scheme, typography, and usage rules, guaranteeing 100% consistency with Gamba’s modern and dynamic brand identity. Add the following to your prompts to enforce these standards across all creative outputs.

## **Gamba Brand Guidelines for Creative Assets**

### **1. Logo Usage**
- **Logo Design**: The Gamba logo features a stylized, abstract graphic symbol resembling a swooping form or a stylized letter "G." It is a single, continuous shape with smooth, rounded edges, composed of thick, curved lines that convey motion and fluidity. The design includes a broad upper curve, a narrower dipping middle section, and a lower curve, creating a dynamic, asymmetrical appearance.
- **Text Element**: The word "GAMBA" must always appear below the graphic symbol in uppercase letters. Use a bold, sans-serif typeface that is clean, modern, and slightly condensed, with uniform spacing between letters.
- **Proportions and Placement**: The graphic symbol must be positioned directly above the "GAMBA" text. Maintain the original proportions of both elements—do not distort, stretch, or alter the logo in any way. The logo must always be used in its entirety, with the symbol and text together.

### **2. Color Scheme**
- **Logo Color**: The logo must be presented in one of two color variants:
  - **Teal Version**: A vibrant teal color, specifically a bright, medium-toned cyan-teal (hex code approximately #00C4B4). Use this on light or neutral backgrounds (e.g., white or light gray) for strong visibility.
  - **White Version**: A solid white version of the logo. Use this on dark backgrounds (e.g., black or dark gray) to ensure high contrast.
- **Backgrounds**: Place the logo on a background that provides strong contrast:
  - Teal logo: Use light or neutral backgrounds.
  - White logo: Use dark backgrounds, preferably solid black.
- **Color Consistency**: The logo must only be teal or white—do not introduce additional colors, gradients, or effects to the logo itself. The "GAMBA" text must match the graphic symbol’s color (teal or white).

### **3. Design Style**
- **Aesthetic**: Reflect Gamba’s modern, clean, and dynamic brand identity in all assets. Designs should feel sleek, professional, and energetic, mirroring the logo’s sense of motion.
- **Typography**: For additional text (e.g., taglines), use a bold, sans-serif typeface matching the logo’s style. Keep it clean and modern, ensuring it complements rather than overshadows the logo.
- **Visual Elements**: Supplementary graphics (e.g., icons, illustrations) should be minimalist and abstract, using smooth lines and curves to echo the logo’s fluidity. Avoid complex or cluttered visuals.

### **4. Clear Space and Visibility**
- **Clear Space**: Maintain sufficient clear space around the logo to preserve its prominence. Do not place other elements too close, as this reduces its impact.
- **Contrast**: Ensure high contrast between the logo and background. The logo must stand out clearly and not blend into the design.

### **5. Do’s and Don’ts**
- **Do**:
  - Use the correct logo color (teal or white) based on the background.
  - Keep the logo’s shape, proportions, and symbol-text pairing intact.
  - Use high-contrast backgrounds to enhance visibility.
  - Include the "GAMBA" text with the graphic symbol in all instances.
- **Don’t**:
  - Alter the logo’s shape, color, or proportions.
  - Use the graphic symbol without the "GAMBA" text.
  - Place the logo on backgrounds that clash with its color or reduce visibility.
  - Add extra colors, effects, or modifications to the logo.
